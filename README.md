## Client architecture
Most of the code lives in the GameActivity, through different fragments.

The least intutitive thing is probably how to add a new kind of tip, since it requires change in a lot of files.

### How to make a new tip?
* Create a new class in `tip`, extending Tip, or reuse an existing one (for instance PlayerStandardTip). It should be a very simple holder to store data you'll need for display, nothing more.
* Create a new `tip.builder` extending TipBuilder
    - Implement the `getTips()` method, returning an ArrayList<? extends Tip>
* Create a new layout, extending CardView.
* Create a `tip.holder`, extending from TipHolder, that will be used to display the tip in the recyclerview.
    - Specify a constructor (where you cache all your findViewById calls)
    - and a `bindtip(Tip)` method. You can safely cast the Tip to your subclass.
    - Also add a static `onCreateViewHolder` method that will be responsible for inflating the view you want to use (don't forget to use both the layout AND the Holder)
* In the `tip.Tip` class, add a reference to your builder in property `tipsBuilders`. Order will define the order of the card, so you may want to add it somewhere else than at the end
* Finally, in `adapter.TipAdapter.onCreateViewHolder`, add a new `else` comparing the value of your class hashcode with the specified integer, and call your `onCreateViewHolder` function.
